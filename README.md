âœ¨ TMDB Data scrapping

    âœ” Scrapped data from the API.
    
    âœ” Used response module to get the information, followed by conversion the data into Json and applied logic to retrieve desired data.
    
    âœ” Finally converted the Dataframe in to CSV file.
    
    

âš¡ Recommended System is the code written in python on Jupyter Notebook.

   ðŸ‘‰First of all cleaned the data and explored it.
   
   ðŸ‘‰Then create tags using different methods of pyhton.
   
   ðŸ‘‰At last compute similarities cosines to analyse similarity between samples.
   
   ðŸ‘‰Used pickel module to dump data and used it in VS code to make local host website.
