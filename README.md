✨ TMDB Data scrapping

    ✔ Scrapped data from the API.
    
    ✔ Used response module to get the information, followed by conversion the data into Json and applied logic to retrieve desired data.
    
    ✔ Finally converted the Dataframe in to CSV file.
    

⚡ Recommended System is the code written in python on Jupyter Notebook.

   👉First of all cleaned the data and explored it.
   
   👉Then create tags using different methods of pyhton.
   
   👉At last compute similarities cosines to analyse similarity between samples.
   
   👉Used pickel module to dump data and used it in VS code to make local host website.
